# Welcome to the semantle-hack wiki!
* This will be a simple step-by-step guide on how you can uncover the newest "secret word" for https://semantle.com/j.
* First thing to note is that this website pretty simple in the idea that the new word comes from a large secret word list,

* When you first load the webpage, you will be greeted with various options.
* The first thing that caught my eye while I was looking at the webpage was the FAQ Tab; more precisely, Can I see yesterday's word?

* CLICK ON THIS TAB!!!
* Take note of the previous Words. 
* In this example the previous words are **"efficiency", "preparation", "pitcher", "slot", "elephant", "lament", "twist"**

### Part 3

* Somehow you will need to open up your developer tools in the browser, and I believe the shortcut for most web browsers is f12.
* The next step is to click on the network tab, you'll be prompt to reload the tab.
* Find the document that is called secretWords.js?ver2

* **Right click on this and click open in a new tab. **
* After finding this document, we want to find the previous word that we took note of earlier; fortunately, the creator of semantle was pretty lazy.
* The JavaScript only checks to ensure not to use the previous word of the day.
